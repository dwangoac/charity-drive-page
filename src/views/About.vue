            I'm new, who are dwangoAC and TASBot?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">

            in his favorite pastime of playing video games on real hardware. TASBot is in the
            care of his creator and longtime keeper, dwangoAC.

            The plan is to start at 8 AM PST on Saturday May 4 from the Petaluma, CA Tesla
            Supercharger station and drive straight through to Salt Lake City, UT with a
            substantial portion of their journey occurring in the Nevada desert, hence the

            What about safety?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            The Crowd Control incentives will have safety limits built in. Changes to max
            speed will only be made while the vehicle is parked and will not allow any unsafe
            speeds at any time. All donation incentives and effects that can be triggered
            using Crowd Control all have limits in place to ensure safety. If for any reason
            there is a concern about the health and safety of anyone we reserve the right to
            cancel an effect or modify it. Raising money for a good cause is our second highest
            priority behind safety.

          <h3 class="faq-question">
            How is this related to speedrunning?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            The remote Tesla controls come from Crowd Control which is primarily focused on
            gaming and speedrunning. TASBot, while not speedrunning any game, will also be
            in the car along for the ride. TheAxeMan is also looking forward to performing some
            speedrunning along the way and dwangoAC may even try to do some LttP rando.

          <h3 class="faq-question">
            Are you taking donations for equipment?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            100% of stream revenue and donations for the day of the event will be donated
            to NAMI. However, the general upkeep of TASBot and parts for this particular event
            in particular are not cheap. dwangoAC has personally spent over $12,000 on equipment
            and travel costs during past events. If you would like to help offset some of the
            expenses for the trip please join us on Discord and ask how you can help. We're
            generally relying on donations from within our community to cover expenses for this
            trip to ensure that 100% of all donations can go directly to charity.

            Is this the same as Desert Bus for HOPE?
          </h3>
          <p class="faq-answer">
            Desert Bus For HOPE was a big inspiration for this event but is a very different
            model, and also a different part of the Nevada desert. Our event is a single day
            and a single one-way trip but with a longer journey (14+ hours instead of 8). This
            event is also very different for one other reason - we're in an actual car, on an
            actual interstate.
